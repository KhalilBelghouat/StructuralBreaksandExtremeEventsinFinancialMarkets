# Structural Breaks and Extreme Events in Financial Markets

This repository includes the code used in the master's dissertation "Structural Breaks and Extreme Events in Financial Markets" by Khalil Belghouat.

In this thesis, an early warning system was built in order to predict turbulence in the Moroccan stock market and extract its leading indicators.

## Prerequisites

The ```R``` programming language, version 4.2.0, and its statistical and machine learning libraries were used to build all applied models. The ```R``` script _packages.R_ in the _packages_ folder installs and loads all necessary ```R``` packages. 

All operations, from data preprocessing to model estimation, were carried out on the Google Colaboratory platform.
